This configuration represents three nodes in a chain.
n0 -> n1 -> n2

The organization of these nodes isn't strict, but since n0 is only aware of
n1 initially and n1 is only aware of n2 initially, they end up routing in a
chain. If this were a real network they would all connect to each other in a
clique. The reason this doesn't happen with this test configuration is because
nodes are forbidden from connecting to multiple outbound IPs from the same
group, and since all are running on localhost, they never expand beyond their
single outbound peer.
