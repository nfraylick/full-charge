bitcoin_testnet_blocks_containing_burn.txt:
- Contains Bitcoin testnet blocks that contain "burn" transactions, where burn
  transactions are defined as sending to the testnet burn address.
- These blocks and their corresponding transactions are referenced in various
  tests that exercise the BitcoinExchange logic.

bitcoin_testnet_headers_for_burn.txt:
- Contains headers associated with the blocks mentioned above as well as headers
  for a large section of blocks before and after these blocks.
- These headers are used for testing various scenarios related to BitcoinExchange
  transaction validation. For example, testing when a burn transaction does not
  have enough work on top of it to be valid.
